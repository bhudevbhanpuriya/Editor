# CODEIN.it

CODEIN.it is a browser-based code playground focused on delivering a smooth, editor-first experience for writing, running, and organizing code online.

It is designed as a foundation for a larger developer platform, starting with core editor and execution workflows and steadily moving toward richer features and long-term scalability.
